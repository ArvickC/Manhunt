# Manhunt
A simple plugin that mimics dream's manhunts automaticly

## Setup
To setup this plugin, just download the file and place it in your server's "plugins" folder

## Features
- Automaticly Genorate a new world for each game
- No need to restart server for new games
- Join spectator team for upcoming games
- Super simple! :)

## Commands
These are all the commands of the plugin
### /end
This command ends the current manhunt game.
### /spec(tator)
The player that runs this command will join the spectator team for the upcoming round
### /setup <genWorld [true/false]> <speedrunner [player]>
'genWorld' means weather or not the plugin should genorate a new world for the players to play in. This is highly recommended to be 'true', so you don't have to restart the server. The 'speedrunner' is where you put the player name for the person who will be the speedrunner for the game.
